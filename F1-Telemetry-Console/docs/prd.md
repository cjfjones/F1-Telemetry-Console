# F1 Telemetry Receiver Console APp

This application is very simple (stage 1 only). We will recieve data from F1 2024 Xbox over Local LAN and simply stream it in the console app, decoded.

Once we have some sample data, we will build out some models to make some more sense of the data.

Data is streamed over UDP, at frequencies between 10hz and 60hx.
